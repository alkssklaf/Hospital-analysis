# Hospital-analysis
## Project Overview
The primary purpose of this Power BI project is to analyze hospital data to provide valuable insights into operational capabilities and resource management. The intended audience for this Power BI project includes healthcare administrators.
## Features
The Power BI report consists of two pages. The first page presents basic metrics, while the second page provides in-depth metrics specifically for inpatient cases, where patients stay in the hospital. There are two cards visualisations which shows absolute and relative difference of patients in current and previous year:

The cards have green boarder when number is posititve. In case if number is negative, color is red. The numbers will help identify trend for this year in comparison with previous year.

Next is **pie chart** which shows relathionships between day case patients and inpatient. Slicer helps user filter chart by current year or all years:

Pie chart allowing administrators to assess changes over time and adjust resource allocation accordingly. The inpatient count is much lower than the day case count, it tells administrators that the hospital is doing more outpatient treatments, which might mean they are efficient but should check if they have enough resources for patients who need to stay overnight.

Most patients are concentrated in shorter time bands (0-3 months), it indicates efficient patient management.
